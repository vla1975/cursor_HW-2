    <p>
      We have a glimpse now of NASA's latest vision for its first crewed Mars
      mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agency released(opens in new tab) its top objectives for a 30-day,
      two-person Mars surface mission on Tuesday (May 17) and asked the public
      to provide feedback on how the planning is going. Submissions were
      initially due on May 31, but that deadline was recently extended to June
      3.
    </p>
    <p>
      NASA aims to launch astronauts to Mars by the late 2030s or early 2040s.
      Making that vision a reality will be challenging. Assuming the funding and
      technology come into play at the right time, for example, the round-trip
      travel time would still be about 500 days given the distance between Earth
      and Mars.
